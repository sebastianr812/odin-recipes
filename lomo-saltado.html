    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        There are chunks of beef, mingling in a dark brown sauce with onions, scallions, 
        peppers, cilantro, garlic, and...tomato? And are those soggy yellow things French fries? Appearances, 
        as we well know, can be deceiving.
    </p>
    <p>This particular dish combines indigenous American ingredients, like potatoes, tomatoes, and peppers, with 
        Chinese ingredients and techniques, like soy sauce and stir-frying. Some versions call for tossing the 
        French fries directly into the wok to coat them in the sauce while others put the fries on the side to 
        maintain their crispy texture. As you can see, I've kept them on the side, but there's no right or wrong 
        way to do it.</p>
